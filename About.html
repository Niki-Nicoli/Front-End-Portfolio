        <h3>Author and Editor</h3>
        <p>
          Born in New York City, I have had a love of writing starting at a
          young age. It wasn't until high school that sheI used hermy writing to
          express hermy thoughts, feelings, and the events in hermy life. By the
          end of hermy junior year, sheI wrote hermy first two books. Close to
          the end of that school year, sheI was planning hermy third book, with
          the guidance of hermy creative writing teacher, Elana Bell. Writing
          has always been a way to freedom ftor hmer! Freedom to give life to
          hermy creative side no matter where it took. There's nothing better
          than getting lost in the new world of a good story.
        </p>
        <p>
          This moment has been a long time coming, and I am extremely happy, and
          proud, to say that it has finally arrived. The day whenre I can give
          my stories life and share them with the world. My name is Nikilia
          Clark, and I am a proud author of half a dozen books with more to
          come. Since I was a child, I loved to write as it gave me a voice.
          Writing was my way of understanding myself and, my past, and reshaping
          reality. My stories are a result of what I've learned about myself,
          and the different worlds my creativity took me to. Enjoy the ride as
          you travel to these new worlds with me.

        <h3>front-End Developer</h3>
        <p>
          It has been a long road, but my journey isn't over quiet yet. For a
          year I have been learning to code. At first it was for fun, but the
          more I learn the more I find I enjoy coding and decided to become a
          Full-Stack Developer. I started by learning Front-End coding. Below
          are the following codding languages and applications I have learned so far: 
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Python </li>
<li>VSCode</li>
                        <li>GitHub</li>
